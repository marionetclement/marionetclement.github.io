My Wedding Website
=========
Based on [Jekyll Photo Grid Gallery](https://github.com/nadjetey/GridGallery) by [nadjetey](https://github.com/nadjetey)

This implementation brings a parent "category menu" home which then lead to "category gallery" pages.

## Licensing
- All content and images are "private", please do not use these at all. (so wtf do I push them to a public repo ?)
- The code itself is as free as the original code from @nadjetey, enjoy. (oh yeah, that's why !) (and also the free hosting ;-)

## Documentation
Please refer to [the original readme](https://github.com/nadjetey/GridGallery).
